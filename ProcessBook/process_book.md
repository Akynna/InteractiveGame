# Concept of the game

The main goal of this project was to create something that will allow young students to learn how to interact with each other or with other persons in the context of their apprenticeship.

Many situations can be possible : how to talk politely to a new client in a shop, how to approach other colleagues, how to welcome someone new, and so on.
All of these everyday applications may seem easy to handle for some people, but for others that have more difficulties with communicating, this game can be a great way of training !

In this game,  the user is immersed in a story and meet multiple different characters. Depending on the choices the player has decided to take will derive different scenarios. The objective is to learn how people would react to what the user has decided to say / to do and to see the multiple possible endings.



## Inspirations

Similar experiences already exists in the industry of gaming. A lot of people have been reading _**Choose Your Path Story Books**_ since their childhood and now this concept has been transformed into video games. What makes this kind of entertainment so popular is the possibility to test different scenarios and see their consequences.

A lot of games that I have experienced inspired me for this project.
