# Process Book

This file explain all the steps and ideas I have taken to create this project.

# Summary


# Concept of the game

The main goal of the game was to create something that will allow young students to learn how to interact with each other.
Many situations can be possible : how to welcome new client in a shop, how to approach other colleagues, how to talk politely to someone new, etc.
All of these everyday applications may seem easy to handle for some people, but for others that have more difficulties with communicating, this game can be a great way of training !

# Inspirations

Similar experiences already exists in the industry of game.
